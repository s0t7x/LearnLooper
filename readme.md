# LearnLooper
*'LearnLooper'* is designed to organize weekly workflows. Created for students *'LearnLooper'* is originally made to organize learntime.

### **What is *Learntime*?**
Learntime is the time a student should invest learning at home.

Imagine you got 6 courses and in every course you write an exam.
You have each course 2 hours a week and youre advised to invest extra 4 hours a week.
May you won't invest exactly 4 hours. May you won't invest your free time at all.
**BUT:** At the end of one semester you're willing to learn for your exams in order to pass.
**THEN: You should invest your time wisely.**
Fairly split your free time. Do not undertake the risk of getting mad!

## You should use *'LearnLooper'* to get yourself perfectly organized.
